## Algorithm Overview

This project utilizes an improved version of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and High-Level K-Nearest Neighbors (HL-KNN) algorithms. The enhancements focus on addressing the limitations of the HL-KNN algorithm while maintaining its strengths, such as effectiveness, ease of implementation, and interpretability. The improved algorithm is versatile for both regression and classification tasks and handles discrete and categorical data efficiently. It also supports incremental updates without the need for pre-training new data.

### Key Features

- **Enhanced HL-KNN:** An extension of the HL-KNN algorithm that boosts performance.
- **Reduced Computation Time:** Optimized to decrease the time needed for predictions by minimizing the number of Euclidean distance calculations.
- **Validated Improvements:** Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over the original HL-KNN algorithm across multiple datasets.
